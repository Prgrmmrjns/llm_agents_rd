Choices:
A. Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase
B. ATP Binding Cassette Transporter-1
C. Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein
D. ApoCII

"Question: Small intestinal biopsy is diagnostic in :a) Whipple's diseaseb) Abetalipoproteinemiac) Celiac diseased) Agammaglobulinemia
Choices:

B. bcd
C. abd
D. ab
Answer:",C,C,"The evidence provided clearly states that small intestinal biopsy is diagnostic for Abetalipoproteinemia (b). The question asks which option is not true regarding small intestinal biopsies being diagnostic. Therefore, we need to select the answer choice that does NOT include 'b'. Options A and D include 'b', so they are eliminated. Option B includes both 'b' and 'c', leaving us with Option C as it includes 'a' and 'd', but not 'b'.",1,10,2

B. bc
C. de
D. bd
Answer:",C,C,"The evidence provided indicates that intermittent dysphagia is likely caused by diffuse esophageal spasm. According to the summary from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_dysphagia, diffuse esophageal spasm is listed as a cause of intermittent dysphagia. Therefore, the correct answer should include option 'e' which corresponds to diffuse esophageal spasm. The only choice that includes 'e' is C (de).",2,10,3

Choices:
A. Smooth narrowing of esophagus
B. Dilated touous esophagus
C. Absence of air in the fundus
D. Exaggerated peristalsis
Answer:",D,D,"The question asks for the radiological evidence that is NOT related to Achalasia cardia. According to the provided evidence from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_achalasia), the typical radiological findings of Achalasia cardia include smooth narrowing of the esophagus, dilated tortuous esophagus, and absence of air in the fundus. Exaggerated peristalsis is not mentioned as a typical finding for Achalasia cardia. Therefore, option D (Exaggerated peristalsis) is the correct answer.",1,10,4
