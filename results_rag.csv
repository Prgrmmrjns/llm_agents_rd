Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': 'Plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride are not extremely low in Abetalipoproteinemia.', 'B': 'Manifesting in early childhood with diarrhea is not a feature of Abetalipoproteinemia.', 'C': 'Progressive pigmented retinopathy is NOT seen in Abetalipoproteinemia.', 'D': 'Neurological manifestation as ataxia in the first decade is NOT a feature of Abetalipoproteinemia.'}",D,D,{'D': 'Selected by process of elimination after analyzing multiple chunks'},Multiple sources,2,10
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': 'Abeta lipoproteinemia is caused by a deficiency of Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase.', 'B': 'Abeta lipoproteinemia is caused by a deficiency of ATP Binding Cassette Transporter-1.', 'C': 'Abeta lipoproteinemia is caused by a deficiency of Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein.', 'D': 'Abeta lipoproteinemia is caused by a deficiency of ApoCII.'}",C,C,"{'C': ""1. Relevant information found: The source text states that Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by changes (mutations or variants) in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (_MTTP_) gene and refers to it as microsomal triglyceride transfer protein deficiency.\n2. Logical connection: Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTTP) is a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the formation of lipoproteins, particularly chylomicrons and VLDL. A deficiency of MTTP would affect the assembly and secretion of these lipoproteins, aligning with the description provided.\n3. Alternative interpretations: The term 'microsomal triglyceride transfer protein' could potentially be misinterpreted as mitochondrial if not carefully read; however, in this context, it clearly refers to the same protein involved in lipid metabolism.\n4. Conclusion: The source text explicitly confirms that mutations in _MTTP_ cause Abetalipoproteinemia, thus providing conclusive evidence for the statement.""}",https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/abetalipoproteinemia/,2,10
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': ""Small intestinal biopsy can diagnose Whipple's disease."", 'B': 'Abetalipoproteinemia cannot be diagnosed using small intestinal biopsy.', 'C': 'Celiac disease can be diagnosed using small intestinal biopsy.', 'D': 'Agammaglobulinemia cannot be diagnosed using small intestinal biopsy.'}",Unclear,C,{},,6,0
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Achalasia?,"{'A': 'Intermittent dysphagia is caused by Stricture and Reflux esophagitis.', 'B': 'Intermittent dysphagia is caused by Reflux esophagitis and Achalasia cardia.', 'C': 'Intermittent dysphagia is caused by Diffuse esophageal spasm and Pharyngeal diverticulum.', 'D': 'Intermittent dysphagia is caused by Achalasia cardia and Pharyngeal diverticulum.'}",A,C,{'A': 'Selected by process of elimination after analyzing multiple chunks'},Multiple sources,2,10
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Achalasia?,"{'A': 'Achalasia cardia is characterized by the absence of smooth narrowing of esophagus on radiological evidence.', 'B': 'A dilated tortuous esophagus is NOT a characteristic feature of Achalasia cardia as seen on radiological evidence.', 'C': 'The presence of air in the fundus is related to Achalasia cardia on radiological evidence.', 'D': 'Exaggerated peristalsis is NOT observed in patients with Achalasia cardia on radiological evidence.'}",D,D,"{'D': ""1. Relevant information found: 'The classic finding on the barium swallow is... with dilatation of the proximal esophagus and lack of peristalsis during fluoroscopy.'\n2. Logical connection: The statement claims that exaggerated peristalsis is NOT observed in patients with Achalasia cardia, which aligns perfectly with the source text mentioning a 'lack of peristalsis' during fluoroscopy.\n3. Alternative interpretations: There are no alternative interpretations as the lack of peristalsis clearly contradicts the presence of exaggerated peristalsis.\n4. Conclusion: The source text explicitly confirms the statement, providing conclusive evidence that exaggerated peristalsis is not observed in patients with Achalasia cardia.""}",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519515/## Introduction,1,10
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Achalasia?,"{'A': 'Nifedipine is used for Achalasia cardia.', 'B': 'Propranolol is used for Achalasia cardia.', 'C': 'Atenolol is used for Achalasia cardia.', 'D': 'Bethnecol is used for Achalasia cardia.'}",A,A,"{'A': ""1. Relevant information found: 'Pharmacologic treatments include...calcium channel blockers to reduce the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure.' and 'Calcium channel blockers inhibit the entry of calcium into the cells blocking smooth muscle contraction, leading to a decrease in LES pressure'.\n2. Logical connection: Calcium channel blockers are explicitly mentioned as a treatment for reducing the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in achalasia cardia. Nifedipine is a well-known calcium channel blocker commonly used for this purpose.\n3. Alternative interpretations: There could be other calcium channel blockers besides nifedipine, but the statement does not specify any particular drug and nifedipine is indeed used clinically for achalasia.\n4. Conclusion: The source text provides conclusive evidence that calcium channel blockers are used in the treatment of Achalasia cardia, supporting the implicit use of nifedipine.""}",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519515/## Treatment / Management,2,10
