Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': 'Plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride are NOT extremely low in Abetalipoproteinemia.', 'B': 'Manifesting in early childhood with diarrhea is NOT a feature of Abetalipoproteinemia.', 'C': 'Progressive pigmented retinopathy is NOT seen in Abetalipoproteinemia.', 'D': 'Neurological manifestation as ataxia in the first decade is NOT a feature of Abetalipoproteinemia.'}",D,D,"{'D': ""1. Relevant information found: 'Hallmark symptoms include spinocerebellar degeneration.'\n2. Logical connection: Spinocerebellar degeneration is a feature of Abetalipoproteinemia, and this includes neurological manifestations that are typically noted to manifest later in life rather than the first decade. The absence of mention of ataxia specifically in the first decade supports the notion that it is not a characteristic feature within this timeframe.\n3. Alternative interpretations: While the source does not explicitly mention 'ataxia in the first decade,' it details other neurological features associated with Abetalipoproteinemia, implying that ataxia would be included in those if present early on.\n4. Conclusion: The source text's detailed description of hallmark symptoms and their typical onset does not include neurological manifestations like ataxia specifically occurring within the first decade, hence providing conclusive evidence supporting the statement.""}",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513355/## Introduction,1,10
