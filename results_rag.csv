Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': 'Plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride are normal or elevated', 'B': 'Does not manifest in early childhood with diarrhea', 'C': 'Progressive pigmented retinopathy is not seen', 'D': 'Neurological manifestations other than ataxia appear before the first decade'}",B,D,"The statement 'Does not manifest in early childhood with diarrhea' is TRUE based on the provided information. The evidence states that Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by low or absent levels of plasma cholesterol, LDLs, and VLDLs due to mutations in the MTTP gene. There is no mention of diarrhea being a manifestation in early childhood. On the other hand: A is FALSE because ABL is associated with low or absent levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, not normal or elevated levels; C is FALSE because progressive pigmented retinopathy can be seen in ABL patients due to vitamin E deficiency caused by impaired lipoprotein assembly; D is FALSE as neurological manifestations typically appear after the first decade.",2,5
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': 'The disease is due to a deficiency of Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase', 'B': 'The disease is NOT due to a deficiency of ATP Binding Cassette Transporter-1', 'C': 'The disease is due to a deficiency of Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein', 'D': 'The disease is NOT due to a deficiency of ApoCII'}",C,C,"The disease Abetalipoproteinemia is due to a deficiency in Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTTP). The supporting evidence directly states that 'Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by a homozygous autosomal recessive mutation in the _MTTP_ gene.' This clear evidence confirms that statement C is TRUE. The other options can be ruled out based on the following counter-evidence: A is FALSE because the disease is not due to a deficiency of Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase, which is not mentioned in relation to Abetalipoproteinemia. B is FALSE because there is no mention that ATP Binding Cassette Transporter-1 deficiency is related to the disease. D is FALSE because there is no mention that ApoCII deficiency is linked to the condition.",1,5
Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,"{'A': ""Whipple's disease is NOT diagnosed through small intestinal biopsy"", 'B': 'Abetalipoproteinemia is diagnosed through small intestinal biopsy', 'C': 'Celiac disease is diagnosed through small intestinal biopsy', 'D': 'Agammaglobulinemia is diagnosed through small intestinal biopsy'}",B,C,"The statement that Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is diagnosed through small intestinal biopsy is directly supported by the evidence provided in option B: 'Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by a homozygous autosomal recessive mutation in the MTTP gene. The text explicitly mentions, 'Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by a homozygous autosomal recessive mutation in the _MTTP_ gene.' This directly supports statement B.",3,5
