      "literature, involving both children and adults [2]. The pathophysi-\n",
      "ology of appendiceal torsion involves both primary and secondary\n",
      "forms. Primary appendiceal torsion is a twisting of the mesoap-\n",

      "On arrival, vitals were within normal limits and a full set of\n",
      "labs and an abdomen/pelvis CT scan with intravenous and oral\n",
      "contrast were obtained. The CT scan showed a dilated appendix\n",
      "(up to 1.4 cm) with mucosal thickening, adjacent fat stranding\n",
      "and edema. There was no mention of appendiceal torsion, masses\n",
      "or lymphadenopathy. There was no fecalith identified. No other\n",
      "non-invasive methods such as abdominal ultrasound were used for\n",
      "diagnosis. Laboratory studies revealed WBC of 7.7, HGB of 15.3, PLT\n",
      "of 298. He was diagnosed with acute appendicitis. He was given IV\n",

      "He was taken to the operating room for a standard laparoscopic\n",
      "appendectomy. Patient was placed supine and underwent general\n",

      "with a 12 mm port. Next, two 5 mm ports were placed in the\n",
      "left lower quadrant and above the pubic symphysis. To increase\n",
      "our visualization of the appendix, we placed the patient in steep\n",
      "Trendelenburg and rotated right side up. It was at this point\n",
      "the appendix came into view. The distal appendix was swollen\n",

      "We untwisted the appendix, exposing a grossly normal appendix\n",

      "the appendix at the cecum. Using a laparoscopic stapler we divided\n",
      "the appendix off the cecum and divided the mesoappendix. There\n",
      "was no gross spillage of the appendix and no appendiceal masses\n",

      "Appendiceal torsion is rare and clinically indistinguishable from\n",
      "acute appendicitis. As with our patient, preoperative radiological\n",
      "imaging is generally unrevealing, and this condition is often diag-\n",
      "nosed during the operation. While there have been no reported\n",
      "cases of appendiceal torsion in EDS patients, there have been\n",
      "reported cases of stomach and testicular torsion [8,9]. Similar to\n",
      "skin hyperelasticity and joint hyperlaxity, ligamentous laxity seen\n",
      "in EDS may make these patients more prone to torsion of abdominal\n",
      "organs.\n",
      "In our patient, primary torsion of the appendix may have been\n",
      "the initial event leading to ischemia and ultimately appendici-\n",
      "tis. Alternatively, tip appendicitis may have led to inflammation,\n",
      "edema and a subsequent lead point for appendiceal torsion. Tra-\n",
      "ditionally, secondary appendiceal torsion is attributed to a mass\n",
      "(cystadenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor) causing twisting of the\n",
      "mesentery, not necessarily inflammation. We cannot definitively\n",
      "say what caused the torsion, although we would hedge toward\n",
      "a primary torsion leading to acute appendicitis. Either way, the\n",
      "patient was appropriately managed and underwent a safe laparo-\n",
      "scopic appendectomy.\n",
      "Surgeries in patients with EDS are associated with signifi-\n",
      "cant complications, including poor wound healing, dehiscence and\n",

      "Appendiceal torsion is rare and clinically indistinguishable from\n",
      "acute appendicitis. As with our patient, preoperative radiological\n",
      "imaging is generally unrevealing, and this condition is often diag-\n",
      "nosed during the operation. While there have been no reported\n",
      "cases of appendiceal torsion in EDS patients, there have been\n",
      "reported cases of stomach and testicular torsion [8,9]. Similar to\n",
      "skin hyperelasticity and joint hyperlaxity, ligamentous laxity seen\n",
      "in EDS may make these patients more prone to torsion of abdominal\n",
      "organs.\n",
      "In our patient, primary torsion of the appendix may have been\n",
      "the initial event leading to ischemia and ultimately appendici-\n",
      "tis. Alternatively, tip appendicitis may have led to inflammation,\n",
      "edema and a subsequent lead point for appendiceal torsion. Tra-\n",
      "ditionally, secondary appendiceal torsion is attributed to a mass\n",
      "(cystadenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor) causing twisting of the\n",
      "mesentery, not necessarily inflammation. We cannot definitively\n",
      "say what caused the torsion, although we would hedge toward\n",
      "a primary torsion leading to acute appendicitis. Either way, the\n",
      "patient was appropriately managed and underwent a safe laparo-\n",
      "scopic appendectomy.\n",
      "Surgeries in patients with EDS are associated with signifi-\n",
