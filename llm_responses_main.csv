0,Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,D,Neurological manifestation as ataxia in the first decade is NOT a feature of Abetalipoproteinemia.,D,True,"The source explicitly states several features of Abetalipoproteinemia, including 'Hypocholesterolemia' and 'Hypotriglyceridemia,' which directly contradicts statement A. It also mentions 'Chronic diarrhea,' which is a feature present in early childhood, thus contradicting statement B. The term 'Abnormality of retinal pigmentation' is included under the Phenotype Data, meaning progressive pigmented retinopathy is a feature, contradicting statement C. However, there is no explicit mention of neurological manifestations such as ataxia not being a feature in the first decade, making statement D true.",
1,Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,C,Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein deficiency is the cause of Abetalipoproteinemia.,C,True,"The source text explicitly states that 'microsomal triglyceride transfer protein' (MTTP) is associated with Abetalipoproteinemia, which corresponds to Mitochondrial Triglyceride Transfer Protein deficiency. This confirms statement C as True.

The source does not provide any explicit information regarding Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase deficiency or ATP Binding Cassette Transporter-1 deficiency in relation to Abetalipoproteinemia, making statements A and B Unclear.

The source also mentions 'Apolipoproteins' under the Phenotype Data section but does not specify ApoCII deficiency. However, since Abetalipoproteinemia is known to be caused by MTTP deficiency (and not ApoCII deficiency), we can infer that statement D is False.",
2,Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Abetalipoproteinemia?,C,"Small intestinal biopsy is diagnostic for Celiac disease but not for Whipple's disease, Abetalipoproteinemia, and Agammaglobulinemia.",C,True,"The source text does not provide information about small intestinal biopsy being diagnostic for any of these diseases. Therefore, statements A and D can be marked as 'False' because the source explicitly states that Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by a mutation in the MTTP gene (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) and lists various phenotypes associated with it but does not discuss small intestinal biopsy. Statement B is 'Unclear' since there's no information regarding its diagnostic specificity for Abetalipoproteinemia via small intestinal biopsy. Statement C can be marked as 'True' because the source mentions 'Steatorrhea', a symptom that could suggest the necessity of small intestinal biopsy, and it does not provide any explicit contradicting evidence.",
3,Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Achalasia?,D,Intermittent dysphagia is caused by stricture and diffuse esophageal spasm.,C,False,"The source text mentions several causes and symptoms associated with achalasia, but it does not explicitly confirm or contradict statements A, B, or C. Specifically, statement A is false because the source does not mention that intermittent dysphagia is caused by stricture and reflux esophagitis in relation to achalasia. Statement B is unclear because there is no explicit information linking reflux esophagitis and achalasia cardia as causes of intermittent dysphagia. Statement C is false because diffuse esophageal spasm and pharyngeal diverticulum are not mentioned as causes of intermittent dysphagia related to achalasia. However, statement D is true since the source does mention 'Dysphagia' and 'Gastroesophageal reflux', which could imply stricture (due to gastroesophageal reflux) and diffuse esophageal spasm.",
4,Which statement is TRUE about the rare disease Achalasia?,D,Exaggerated peristalsis is NOT a radiological evidence of Achalasia cardia.,D,True,"The source text does not provide explicit information about smooth narrowing of the esophagus being a radiological evidence of Achalasia cardia (Option A). Therefore, it is marked as 'Unclear'. The source explicitly mentions symptoms related to eating and drinking difficulties ('Eating', 'Drinking'), which might indicate issues with swallowing but does not confirm or contradict any specific radiological findings. For Option B, the text does not mention a dilated tortuous esophagus in relation to Achalasia cardia, so it is marked as 'False'. Similarly for Option C, the absence of air in the fundus is not mentioned in the context of Achalasia cardia, hence it is marked as 'False'. For Option D, the text does not provide any information about exaggerated peristalsis, so it cannot be confirmed or contradicted. However, considering that only one statement can be true and three need to be false, Option D stands out as a plausible true statement.",
